<h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
Tagged photos in <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> photostreams present a wealth of semantic content
amenable to analysis through machine learning techniques. Clustrr applies
several advanced unsupervised machine learning algorithms (spectral clustering,
agglomerative clustering, self-organizing neural networks) to find hierarchical
structure in the tag co-occurrence relationships of a Flickr photostream.
<p></p>
For example, in my own photostream, Clustrr identifies a tag cluster at a
certain depth in the hierarchy consisting of the tags:
<ul>
    <li>clouds, campanile, storm, clear, sathertower, goldengatebridge,
    night, olympus40150, eastbay, oakland</li>
</ul>
Drilling father into the hierarchy splits this cluster into smaller groups,
for example:
<ul>
    <li>clouds, campanile, storm, clear, sathertower, night</li>
    <li>goldengatebridge, olympus40150, eastbay, oakland</li>
</ul>
The goal of this tech page is to explain the process behind this
classification.

<h2>2. DATA SCRAPING AND STORAGE</h2>
Clicking the "Analyze!" button initiates scraping of the specified Flickr
user's photostream using python bindings to Flickr's <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/">public API</a>.
The JSON returned from Flickr's database in response to a query to the
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.people.getPublicPhotos.html">
<i>people.getPublicPhotos</i></a> endpoint includes parsable semenatic content for
each photo in three fields: tags, title, and description.
Content in all three fields undergoes basic munging to remove troublesome
characters, including html tags and special characters which can ultimately
interfere with the HTML or SVG DOM of the webapp's interface (for example, 
a hashtag uses the '#' symbol which can cause trouble for the javascript selector
mechanism).
<p></p>	
Following parsing and munging, Clustrr inserts the returned information
regarding each photo into a <a href="http://sqlite.org">SQLite</a> database with fast text search capability
enabled by the FTS4 extension.
<p></p>
</div>

<div class="textsection" id="graph">
<h2>3. GRAPH ANALYSIS</h2>
Once scraping completes, Clustrr pulls semantic content about the photos from
the database and transforms it into a weighted <a href="https://networkx.github.io/">NetworkX</a>
<a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/classes.digraph.html">DiGraph</a> object
whose nodes are word-tokens and whose edges are initially token co-occurrences.
The current version of Clustrr uses only tokens generated from tags, rather
than from the photo title or description, to generate the graph. For example,
imagine a photostream consisting of three photos with the following tags:
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Photo 1: berkeley, oakland</li>
<li>Photo 2: berkeley, oakland, campanile</li>
<li>Photo 3: campanile, sathertower</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
The digraph of this photostream would contain four nodes (berkeley, oakland,
campanile, sathertower) and eight edges (berkeley-oakland, oakland-berkeley,
berkeley-campanile, campanile-berkeley, oakland-campanile, campanile-oakland,
campanile-sathertower, sathertower-campanile). The value of the edges would be
the number of times each pair of tags co-occurs; berkeley-oakland and
oakland-berkeley would both have value two, all other edges value one.
This is represented in Figure 1. Even though the co-occurrence data is
symmetric, Clustrr uses a directed graph structure as other useful link weight
metrics are directional.
<p></p>
<div class="figure">

<p></p>
Figure 1: A simple digraph showing fictitious tag co-occurrences.
<p></p>
</div>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors">eigenvalue</a> spectrum of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix#Symmetric_normalized_Laplacian">normalized laplacian</a>
of the affinity matrix of the co-occurrence digraph immediately provides insight
into whether there exists a "natural" number of clusters within the graph which
some optimal set of cuts can isolate. Given the affinity matrix <i>A</i> and degree
matrix <i>D</i> of the digraph (in-degree and out-degree are equal for token
co-occurrence), the normalized graph laplacian is given by:
<p></p>
<img class="equation" src="../images/laplacian.png" height="20">
<p></p>
A helpful heuristic regarding the number of distinct clusters in a graph goes as follows:
a natural number of clusters exists in the graph if the eigenvalues of <i>L</i> display
a clear gap. A typical eigenvalue spectrum as displayed in the Clustrr GUI
is shown in Figure 2 (left), and unfortunately displays no clear gap. For comparison, we
also show the eigenvalue spectrum and obvious eigengap for a more structured
dataset discussed below. The lack of an obvious gap in the Flickr
dataset indicates that an obvious set of graph-cuts to divide the tags into clusters
probably does not exist, due to the richly co-occurring nature of the tags.
<p></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/eigengap.png" height=250></img>
<p></p>
<div class="caption">
Figure 2: (left) The eigenvalue spectrum of the counts co-occurrence matrix
for a typical, well-tagged Flickr <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/parksdh">
photostream</a> (taken from a screenshot of Clustrr). No obvious gap is seen.
(right) The eigenvalue spectrum, with two obvious gaps, of a much more structured
dataset; see Figure 4.
</div>
<p></p>
</div>
This being the case, we require
different methods of clustering the tags which can reveal structure in their
organziation at a variable level of precision. In formulating these methods,
additional co-occurrence metrics prove valuable. In addition to the simple
tag co-occurrence, Clustrr also calculates the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index">Jaccard index</a>:
<p></p>
<img class="equation" src="../images/jaccard.png" height="45" id="jaccard">
<p></p>
where <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>P<sub>j</sub></i> are sets of posts tagged with particular tokens
<i>i</i> and <i>j</i>, respectively. Clustrr also calculates the fuzzy-logic similarity,
an asymmetic metric which requires the digraph structure:
<p></p>
<img class="equation" src="../images/fuzzylogic.png" height="45" id="fuzzylogic">
<p></p>
where <i>x<sub>ik</sub></i> is the number of times tokens <i>x<sub>i</sub></i>
and <i>x<sub>k</sub></i> co-occur. The fuzzy logic similarity indicates to what
degree a token is subsumed within another.
<p></p>
Although the eigenvalue spectrum often fails to identify any obvious structure in
a photostream, eigenspace methods are very useful in analyzing other aspects of the
tag graph. In particular, Clustrr uses the concept of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality#Eigenvector_centrality">
eigenvector centrality</a> to identify which tags are most important in a graph; a cluster
identified by the methods explained below can be represented as a subgraph of
the whole-photostream digraph and the relative importance of the subgraph's tags
can be estimated by the eigenvector centralities of the corresponding co-occurrence
affinity matrix.
</div>
</section>

<section>
<div class="textsection" id="som">
<h2>4. SELF ORGANIZING MAPS</h2>
A fundamental problem in clustering tags from Flickr photostreams is that when
considered as an affinity matrix, each of the <i>N</i> tags is represented by an
<i>N</i>-dimensional feature vector. Most clustering algorithms fail in this case as
the <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">dimensionality of the problem is too high</a>.
Therefore, Clustrr first reduces the dimensionality of the problem using a type of neural network called a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map">self-organizing map (SOM)</a>,
also known as a Kohonen map (other non-linear approaches to
reducing the dimensionality of the affinity matrix worth exploring might
include: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomap">isomap algorithm</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammon_mapping">Sammon's mapping</a>, or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder">autoencoding neural networks</a>;
linear approaches such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">PCA</a>
usually fail in cases such as this as it is unlikely that the data exists on any
sort of linear manifold).
<p></p>
In brief, the SOM used in Clustrr is a 15x15 grid of "neurons", each of which
are represented by a vector <i>W<sub>i,j</sub></i> with the same dimensionality as the feature
vectors composing the affinity matrix of the tag co-ocurrence graph. The SOM is
trained by repeatedly exposing it to a set of training vectors <i>V</i>, in this case
rows of the affinity matrix formed from the fuzzy-logic similarity (some evidence exists
in the literature that using such asymmetric features may improve learning).
When a training input <i>V<sub>k</sub></i> is seen by the neural
network, the "winning" neuron is said to be that neuron whose weight vector has
the minimum Euclidean distance to the training vector. All the neuron weights
<i>W</i> are updated after each exposure according to the equation:
<p></p>
<img class="equation" src="../images/som_update.png" height="57">
<p></p>
where <i>d<sub>i,j</sub></i> is the distance on the grid between the "winning"
neuron for the input vector and neuron at site <i>(i, j)</i>, <i>r(&#964)</i>
is the "learning rate", and <i>&#963(&#964)</i> is a
neighborhood size parameter. For the training of the neural network to converge,
the value of both <i>r(&#964)</i> and <i>&#963(&#964)</i> must decrease as
training progresses and the training epoch <i>&#964</i> increases. By updating
not just the winning neuron to replicate an input vector but also its
neighbors, similar vectors become grouped in the SOM and the high-dimensional
topology of the input set is retained in the two-dimensional projection of the
map. Figure 3 shows a cartoon representation of a SOM with winning neuron and
surrounding neighbors illuminated according to the strength of their learning.
<p></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/training.png" height=250></img>
<p></p>
<div class="caption">
Figure 3: An input training vector Vi activates a particular neuron (orange)
in the SOM, training both it and the neighboring neurons (green).
</div>
<p></p>
</div>
Because each grid site in the SOM has the same dimensionality as the input
vectors, it is common to visualize the SOM through its associated
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-matrix">U-matrix</a>.
The value of the U-matrix at any position <i>(i, j)</i> in the SOM grid is a function of the
distance between the weight vector <i>W<sub>i,j</sub></i> at that site and the
weight vectors of its nearest neighbors. In Clustrr, the value of the U-matrix
is given by the sum of the euclidean distances between the weight vector on a site and
the weight vectors of its nearest neighbors. Presented with a reverse colormap, this
means that white (black) portions the of U-matrix represent regions of high
(low) similarity between SOM weight vectors. In this way, naturally occurring
tag clusters may be identified visually.

eight equally-distributed points in HLS color space. Right: the U-matrix of the
SOM, showing strong local differences in SOM prototypes moving between
the clusters.
</div>
<p></p>
</div>
To illustrate the topology preservation of the SOM and the SOM's representation
as a U-matrix, we show in Figure 4 a SOM trained on test data with a known,
highly clustered structure (left) and its associated U-matrix (right). In this
case, we generated a set of vectors clustered around eight anchor points equally
distributed in hue around a colorwheel with fixed saturation and lightness.
Vectors in each cluster were generated by small random displacements along
RGB components. Because the data in each vector represents color information, we
can show this direct representation of the SOM and easily identify the eight
hues. In the U-matrix, we identify eight white regions of highly similar SOM
prototype vectors, as well as the dark transition regions between them.

<div class="textsection" id="agglomerative">
<h2>5. AGGLOMERATIVE CLUSTERING OF THE SOM</h2>
In the absence of a good "natural" number of clusters in the matix co-occurrence
matrix (as shown by the typical lack of a strong gap in the eigenvalue spectrum,
section 2 above), Clustrr instead builds a dendogram of candidate clusters
through iterative <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering"> 
agglomeration</a> of neighboring clusters in the SOM. The algorithm
proceeds as follows:
<ol>
<li>Assign each feature vector from the affinity matrix to a neuron, initiating
a cluster; there is no restriction on number of vectors initially
assigned to a neuron.</li>
<li>Assign unassigned neurons in the SOM are assigned to the nearest labeled
cluster through the k-nearest-neighbors algorithm; ties are broken at random.</li>
<li>While more than 1 cluster exists:
<ol>
<li>Find all pairs of neighboring clusters</li>
<li>Combine the pair of clusters which minimizes some pair-wise objective function</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p></p>
In the current version of Clustrr, the objective function minimized in the iterative
agglomeration is the sum of U-matrix values within a candidate agglomerated cluster.
Additionally, the subgraph formed by the tokens corresponding to the member vectors
of the cluster must be connected.
<p></p>
While a variety of objective functions exist in the literature for the agglomerative
clustering of feature vectors, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward's_method">
Ward's method</a> or other variance-based metrics, minimizing the summed U-matrix value of
the SOM gives several advantages. First, the topology-preserving character of the
SOM makes the neighbor relationship between clusters a powerful indication of
similarity. Second, as the U-matrix is scalar and precomputed, agglomerating based
on its value is extremely fast. In general, agglomerative clustering runs in
<i>O(n<sup>3</sup>)</i> time, but the constraint on agglomerating only neighboring clusters
reduces the candidate space and speeds the algorithm considerably.
</div>
</section>


<section>
<div class="textsection" id="reproducibility">
<h2>6. CLUSTER REPRODUCIBILITY</h2>
Not all the clusters found in the agglomeration reproduce well in all trained
SOMs due to the random initialization of the neuron weight vectors and the
fact that at a given level of the dendogram the distinctions between clusters
may be forced and suboptimal. For this reason, it is important to examine the
reproducibility of clusters.
<p></p>
To measure the reproducibility of clusters, we train and agglomerate several
SOMs. For each level of the agglomeration dendogram (i.e, for a given number
of agglomerated clusters), we count the co-occurrence of each pair of tokens.
In other words, we might find that "berkeley" and "sathertower" co-occur 20
times out of 25 SOMs when there are 10 clusters, but "berkeley" and
"sanfrancisco" co-occur only 15 times out of 25 SOMs when there are 10
clusters. From this, we would conclude that "berkeley" and "sathertower"
should be probably be clustered together at the 10-cluster level of the
dendogram in preference to clustering "berkeley" and "sanfrancisco".
<p></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/reproducibility.png" height=250></img>
<p></p>
<div class="caption">
Figure 5: (left) Vector co-occurrences in repeated SOM training and cluster
agglomeration of the SOM shown in Figure 4. (right) The same vector
co-occurrences rearranged according to the labels found by spectral
clustering. Off-diagonal elements show where similar clusters are sometimes
confused for each other.
</div>
<p></p>
</div>
To separate clusters based on the reproducibility of the agglomerative
clustering, we perform spectral clustering of the dendogram co-occurrence
matrix. Because we know the number of clusters in each level of the dendogram,
we do not encouter the typical problem in unsupervised clustering of deciding
an optimal number of clusters. Both stages of the spectral clustering (the
laplacian eigenvalue decomposition and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">k-means clustering</a>)
are handled within Clustrr by the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#spectral-clustering">
scikit-learn library</a>.
<p></p>
We show an example outcome of this process in Figure 5. We used the same
data as was used to generate the colorful SOM and U-matrix in Figure 4, but
repeated the training and agglomerative clustering 50 times. At left, we show
the co-occurrence of each pair of vectors at the eight-cluster level of the
dendogram (white indicates frequent co-occurrence). After spectral clustering,
the highly organized cluster structure is revealed as the bright blocks along the
diagonal. The performance of the clustering is not entirely reproducible: vectors
are sometimes assigned to a wrong, but similar cluster (for example, blue instead
of purple). This effect appears as power outside of the diagonal blocks.
Consequently, clusters with minimal off-diagonal power are the most reproducible.

<h2>7. USER INTERACTION</h2>

The Clustrr interface defines and expects one dominant mode of user interaction
with the data analyzed from a photostream. The top row, consisting of (A), (B),
and (C) in Figure 6, presents top-level information about cluster relationships.
The second row, consisting of (D), shows those tags present in selected clusters.
The third row, consisting of (E), shows those photos with the selected tags.
<p></p>
In (A), Clustrr displays the eigenvalue spectrum of the tag co-occurence affinity
matrix and a draggable slider to traverse the dendogram and change the number
of agglomerated clusters. As discussed earlier, in a typical photostream the
tags do not divide into obvious clusters, and the eigenspectrum lacks an obvious
gap. Cluster number is selected by dragging the blue vertical indicator along
the x-axis.
<p></p>
In (B), Clustrr displays the U-matrix of one of the several SOMs trained to
examine cluster reproducibility. Clusters borders are delineated on the SOM
as pink lines. Clicking on an neuron/grid-site in the SOM will select the
cluster which owns that site and highlight it in blue. Because clusters are
assigned based on a composite of many trained SOMs and (B) displays
a single particular SOM, clusters displayed in Clustrr may violate the
requirement enforced in agglomeration that clusters be contiguous. This
is particularly the case for clusters with poor reproducibility.
<p></p>
In (C), Clustrr displays the cluster reproducibility matrix found through
the spectral clustering of tag co-occurences in the agglomeration of many SOMs.
On-diagonal block elements are outlined in pink and may be selected and
deselected by clicking. Highly reproducible clusters are consistently white
and have little off-diagonal power in their rows and columns.
<p></p>
In (D), tags present in the selected cluster are displayed as a word cloud. Clustrr encodes
the importance of each tag along two different axes: counts and centralities.
Counts are encoded by size (more counts equals bigger text), while eigenvector
centrality is encoded as color (more red equals more central, more blue
equals less central). If more than one cluster is selected, relative sizes and
centralities are NOT recalculated for a composite graph as an arbitrary
sub-graph of the photostream is probably not connected. Tags can be selected by
clicking; Clustrr shows tag selection by changing their color to gold.
The dynamic numeral behind the word cloud indicates the number of photos
containing all selected tags.
<p></p>
In (E), thumbnails of photos containing all selected tags are displayed as
links to the original photopage on Flickr. Up to 15 photos are displayed at
a time; if there are more than 15 photos in the tag intersection, results
may be scrolled through the up- and down-arrows.

<h2>7. TOOL DETAILS</h2>
All of Clustrr is written in Python (back) and Javascript (front) and is entirely
the work of Daniel Parks (email dhparks at lbl dot gov), obviously excepting those
libraries and packages credited below. 
<p></p>
In front, both <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://d3js.org">D3</a> see extensive use in the
manipulation of the HTML and SVG DOM, respectively. The progress indicator,
the plot of the eigenvalue spectrum, the display of the SOM U-matrix,
the cluster reproducibility selector, the number-of-photos indicator, and
the thumbnail explorer are custom javascript objects implementing D3- or jQuery-
based methods for interaction. The word cloud is based on the <a href="https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud">
d3-cloud library</a>, modified to allow for custom colors, clickable text, and optimal
sizing to fit the bounding box. Best efforts have been made to make the
interface as responsive as possible, but the large number of SVG elements in
the SOM and the difficulty of finding an optimal size of the word-cloud 
scaling can sometimes lead to slowdowns.
<p></p>
In back, the web application uses <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> for request handling and routing.
Flickr communication is managed through the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sybren/flickrapi/">FlickrAPI package</a> and
scraped semantic data gets stored in SQLite databases with the <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html">FTS4 extension</a>.
Graph data-structures are managed by the tools provided by <a href="https://networkx.github.io/">NetworkX</a>.
Several highly-optimized <a href="http://numpy.org">Numpy</a> routines handle the heavy numerical
calculations for training the SOM (interestingly, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/numexpr/">numexpr</a> implementation
of the calculations proved slower than numpy), while the kNN step of the
agglomerator and the spectral clustering of the reproducibility matrix use the
codes provided by <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a>. Clustrr uses Python multiprocessing where
appropriate, most obviously in training duplicated SOMs to examine cluster
reproducibility.
